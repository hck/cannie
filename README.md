# Cannie

Cannie is a gem for authorization/permissions checking.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'cannie'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cannie

## Usage

### Define permissions

Permissions are defined in Permissions class, which could be generated by Rails generator:

    rails g cannie:permissions

Than you can define all the permissions you want inside ::initialize method of Permissions class:

    class Permissions
      include Cannie::Permissions

      def initialize(user)
        if user.admin?
          allow :manage, on: :all
        else
          allow :read, on: Post
          allow :read, on: Comment
          allow :create, on: Comment

          # allow delete comments, that were created only if user has posted those comments
          allow :delete, on: Comment do |*comments|
            comments.all?{|c| c.user_id == user.id}
          end
        end
      end
    end

### Checking permissions

To be sure that permissions checking is handled in each action of your controller, add `check_permissions` method call to your controllers:

    class PostsController < ApplicationController
      check_permissions

      #...
    end

It's also possible to set a condition by specifying `:if` or `:unless` options for `check_permissions` call:

    class PostsController < ApplicationController
      check_permissions if: :some_method

      #...
    end

or

    class PostsController < ApplicationController
      check_permissions if: ->(controller) { controller.some_method }

      #...
    end

or

    class PostsController < ApplicationController
      check_permissions unless: some_method

      #...
    end

or

    class PostsController < ApplicationController
      check_permissions unless: ->(controller) { controller.some_method }

      #...
    end

To skip checking permissions for controller, add `skip_check_permissions` method call:

    class PagesController < ApplicationController
      skip_check_permissions

      #...
    end

Checking of permissions on per-action basis is done by calling `permit!` method inside of controller's actions:

    class PostsController < ApplicationController
      check_permissions

      def index
        @posts = Posts.all
        permit! :read, on: posts # checks whether user able to read fetched posts
      end
    end

### Handling of unpermitted access

If user is not permitted for appropriate action, `Cannie::ActionForbidden` exception will be raised.
It can be handled globally by using `rescue_from` inside ApplicationController:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      rescue_from Cannie::ActionForbidden do |exception|
        redirect_to root_path, alert: exception.message
      end
    end
